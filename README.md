# ChemputerOptimizer

The repo contains the optimizer package for Chemputer platform to perform interactive chemical reaction optimizations.

## Usage

```python
from optimizer import ChemputerOptimizer

co = ChemputerOptimizer('<xdl optimization procedure>', '<optimization graph>')
co.prepare_for_optimization(<'path to optimization config'>)
co.optimize('<chempiler instance>')
```

`<xdl optimization procedure>` is any valid `.xdl` procedure with some steps (targeted as optimization parameters) wrapped with *OptimizeStep*, e.g.
```xml
<OptimizeStep
  id="0"
  optimize_properties="{'mass': {'max_value': 0.24, 'min_value': 0.16}}">
  <Add
    reagent="copper(I)iodide"
    vessel="filter"
    mass="0.19 g"
    stir="False" />
</OptimizeStep>
```
Optionally some steps may be wrapped *FinalAnalysis* step with supported analytical method or `interactive` if you want to run optimization loop interactively.
```xml
<FinalAnalysis
  method="method">
  <HeatChill
    vessel="filter"
    temp="25 C"
    time="15 mins" />
</FinalAnalysis>
```

**Note**
You can omit both OptimizeStep and FinalAnalysis wrappers and run optimization of any procedure interactively by instantiating *ChemputerOptimizer* with `interactive=True` attribute.

### Optimizer Client
ChemputerOptimizer now supports interaction with  Summit benchmarking framework (through [SummitServer](https://gitlab.com/croningroup/personal/ail/summitserver)). List of available algorithms is stored in [/client.py](/chemputeroptimizer/utils/client.py). To use them, run SummitServer main loop on chosen host and change the corresponding constants in `client.py`.

## Features

### v0.2.3

* Fixed the bug with preloading results from previous iterations
* `Reproduce` algorithm to check the reaction for reproducibility

## Development

Please check the issue list for the relevant things to do.
If you want to add another algorithm for the optimization, please follow the AbstractAlgorithm class documentation. Testing functions for algorithm evaluation can be found in [/simulation](/tests/simulations/).
